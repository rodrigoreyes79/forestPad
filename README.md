forestPad
=========

An outliner that allows to organize a group of documents using one or more indexes (trees).

## Why another outliner?

I am scratching my own itch here. I am creating a tool I am comfortable with for my personal projects. I like Treepad and Zim, but I needed something a bit more flexible so that I can organize the same group of documents differently based on the task at hand. That's why I am creating ForestPad.

## Why ForestPad?

Because each group of documents may be organized using one or more "trees" (hence, you end up building a "forest"). Neat name, ah? :)
